To resolve the issue, ensure that the parent container has its dimensions explicitly defined. This gives `calc()` a concrete value to base its calculations on.  If the parent's dimensions are determined dynamically, consider using alternative techniques such as `vw`, `vh`, or media queries to achieve the desired responsiveness.  Also, always double-check the order of operations within the `calc()` expression to avoid unexpected results.
